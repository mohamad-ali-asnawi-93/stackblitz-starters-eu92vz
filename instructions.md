# Variables & String

Variables are just named containers that can store one data. This is an example of a variable called name with a string _Haris_ assigned:

```javascript
const name = 'Haris';
```

Strings are just text in programming. They are wrapped with quotation marks: " " .

## Exercise
1. Create a variable called name with your name as a string.

If we want to see what the value of the variable is, we need to use the console.log function.

```javascript
const name = 'Haris';
console.log(name);

// Haris
```

It should print _Haris_ in your console.

2. Create another variable called `lastName` and assign it to the string `'Samingan'` and `console.log` it out.

And the console should look like this code:

```
Haris
Samingan
```
